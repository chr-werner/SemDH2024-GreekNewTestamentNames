## Install and Use

The recommended Python version for this repo is `3.9.18` (see `.python-version`). Dockerimages with Python preinstalled can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). Alternatively you can setup and run a [virtual Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

In your Python environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the projects root directory to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). This will enable you to run the notebooks.

The notebooks will automatically download and install the required packages and modules at runtime in their respective kernel.

## SPARQL Queries

We have utilized a SPARQL query for retrieving an initial list of biblical names in the New Testament.

Endpoint: <https://database.factgrid.de/query>

```sparql
SELECT ?Person ?PersonLabel ?noted ?notedLabel ?GenderLabel ?link ?book
WHERE {
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
  
  ?Person wdt:P2 wd:Q8811.
  ?Person wdt:P143 ?noted.
  ?noted wdt:P8 ?book.

  FILTER (?book IN (wd:Q74942, wd:Q74943, wd:Q74944, wd:Q74945, wd:Q74946, wd:Q74947, wd:Q74948, wd:Q74949, wd:Q74950, wd:Q74951, wd:Q74952, wd:Q74953, wd:Q74954, wd:Q74955, wd:Q74956, wd:Q74957, wd:Q74958, wd:Q74959, wd:Q74960,  wd:Q74961, wd:Q74962, wd:Q74963, wd:Q74964, wd:Q74965, wd:Q74966, wd:Q74967, wd:Q74968)) 
  
  OPTIONAL { ?Person wdt:P154 ?Gender. }
  OPTIONAL { ?link schema:about ?Person ; schema:isPartOf <https://www.wikidata.org/> . }
}
ORDER BY (?PersonLabel)
```

  abstract = {The analysis of textual variants of verses in the New Testament across different manuscripts has mainly been done by close reading with manual effort. With the increasing number of transcriptions of the different manuscripts, quantitative analyses (so-called distant reading) can be used to search for patterns of omission, addition, or other variations, to formulate novel hypotheses to be investigated by close reading. In this work, we present a corpus of biblical names including spelling variation and inflections and their mentions in the transcriptions of the New Testament. By integrating and semantically enriching the data collected from different sources, we established a corpus that can be used for the quantitative study of omission, addition, and variation of such biblical names. To illustrate the corpus, we implement some use cases and show that well-known cases can be quantitatively reproduced. The corpus and all code are published under open licenses to enable reproduction, update, and maintenance.},
