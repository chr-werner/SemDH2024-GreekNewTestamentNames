## Install and Use

The recommended Python version for using this repo is `3.9.18`. Dockerimages with Python preinstalled can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). Alternatively you can setup and run a [virtual Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

In your Python environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the projects root directory to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). This will enable you to run the notebooks.

The notebooks will automatically download and install the required packages and modules at runtime in their respective kernel.

## SPARQL Queries

We have utilized a SPARQL query for retrieving an initial list of biblical names in the New Testament.

Endpoint: <https://database.factgrid.de/query>

```sparql
SELECT ?Person ?PersonLabel ?noted ?notedLabel ?GenderLabel ?link ?book
WHERE {
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
  
  ?Person wdt:P2 wd:Q8811.
  ?Person wdt:P143 ?noted.
  ?noted wdt:P8 ?book.

  FILTER (?book IN (wd:Q74942, wd:Q74943, wd:Q74944, wd:Q74945, wd:Q74946, wd:Q74947, wd:Q74948, wd:Q74949, wd:Q74950, wd:Q74951, wd:Q74952, wd:Q74953, wd:Q74954, wd:Q74955, wd:Q74956, wd:Q74957, wd:Q74958, wd:Q74959, wd:Q74960,  wd:Q74961, wd:Q74962, wd:Q74963, wd:Q74964, wd:Q74965, wd:Q74966, wd:Q74967, wd:Q74968)) 
  
  OPTIONAL { ?Person wdt:P154 ?Gender. }
  OPTIONAL { ?link schema:about ?Person ; schema:isPartOf <https://www.wikidata.org/> . }
}
ORDER BY (?PersonLabel)
```
